* Keybindings Module Overview

The Keybindings module provides comprehensive keyboard shortcuts to enhance Emacs productivity. It includes custom keybindings organized by function, global shortcuts, and integration with various packages like Avy and Expand-Region.

* Components

** keybindings-init.el
Main initialization file that defines all custom keybindings.

* Package Integrations

** Avy
Quick navigation package for jumping to visible text.

*** Features
- Character-based navigation
- Line-based navigation
- Visual selection of targets

*** Key Bindings
- C-c SPC - Jump to character (avy-goto-char-timer)
- C-c j - Jump to line (avy-goto-line)

** Expand-Region
Progressive text selection package.

*** Features
- Expand selection to next logical unit
- Contract selection to previous logical unit
- Language-aware selection expansion

*** Key Bindings
- C-= - Expand region (er/expand-region)
- C-- - Contract region (er/contract-region)

** MWIM (Move Where I Mean)
Intelligent beginning/end of line navigation.

*** Features
- Context-aware movement in code vs comments
- Enhanced C-a and C-e behavior
- Works with programming and text modes

*** Key Bindings
- C-a - Smart beginning of line (mwim-beginning-of-line)
- C-e - Smart end of line (mwim-end-of-line)

* Custom Keybinding Structure

The module uses a hierarchical keybinding system with "C-c k" as the main prefix:

** Buffer Management (C-c k b)
- C-c k b n - Next buffer (next-buffer)
- C-c k b p - Previous buffer (previous-buffer)
- C-c k b k - Kill current buffer (kill-this-buffer)
- C-c k b s - Switch to buffer (switch-to-buffer)
- C-c k b l - List buffers (ibuffer)

** File Operations (C-c k f)
- C-c k f f - Find file (find-file)
- C-c k f s - Save buffer (save-buffer)
- C-c k f w - Write file (write-file)
- C-c k f r - Open recent files (recentf-open-files)

** Project Management (C-c k p) [When Projectile is available]
- C-c k p f - Find file in project (projectile-find-file)
- C-c k p p - Switch project (projectile-switch-project)
- C-c k p s - Search in project (projectile-grep)

** Text Manipulation (C-c k t)
- C-c k t c - Capitalize (capitalize-dwim)
- C-c k t l - Downcase (downcase-dwim)
- C-c k t u - Upcase (upcase-dwim)
- C-c k t r - Reverse region (reverse-region)
- C-c k t f - Fill paragraph (fill-paragraph)

** Line Operations (C-c k l)
- C-c k l d - Duplicate line (duplicate-dwim)
- C-c k l c - Delete trailing whitespace (delete-trailing-whitespace)
- C-c k l n - Move to column (move-to-column)
- C-c k l s - Sort lines (sort-lines)

** Compilation (C-c k c)
- C-c k c c - Compile (compile)
- C-c k c r - Recompile (recompile)

** Debugging (C-c k d)
- C-c k d d - Start GDB (gdb)
- C-c k d t - Toggle debug on error (toggle-debug-on-error)

** Window Management (C-c k w)
- C-c k w s - Split window below (split-window-below)
- C-c k w v - Split window right (split-window-right)
- C-c k w c - Close window (delete-window)
- C-c k w o - Delete other windows (delete-other-windows)

** UI Toggles (C-c k u)
- C-c k u l - Toggle line numbers (global-display-line-numbers-mode)
- C-c k u h - Toggle line highlighting (global-hl-line-mode)
- C-c k u w - Toggle whitespace mode (whitespace-mode)
- C-c k u f - Toggle auto-fill mode (auto-fill-mode)

** Help (C-c k h)
- C-c k h k - Describe key (describe-key)
- C-c k h f - Describe function (describe-function)
- C-c k h v - Describe variable (describe-variable)
- C-c k h m - Describe mode (describe-mode)

** Search (C-c k s)
- C-c k s s - Search forward (isearch-forward)
- C-c k s r - Query replace (query-replace)
- C-c k s f - Find with grep (find-grep)

* Global Key Bindings

** Standard Operations
- C-x C-b - List buffers (ibuffer)
- C-c / - Comment/uncomment region (comment-or-uncomment-region)
- C-c n - Forward paragraph (forward-paragraph)
- C-c p - Backward paragraph (backward-paragraph)
- C-x C-s - Save buffer (save-buffer)

** Window Navigation
- C-x <up> - Move to window above (windmove-up)
- C-x <down> - Move to window below (windmove-down)
- C-x <left> - Move to window left (windmove-left)
- C-x <right> - Move to window right (windmove-right)

** Text Selection Helpers
- C-c s l - Select current line (my/select-line)
- C-c s p - Select current paragraph (my/select-paragraph)
- C-c s f - Select current function (my/select-function)

* Custom Functions

** my/select-line
Selects the entire current line, including the newline character.

** my/select-paragraph
Selects the current paragraph, including surrounding whitespace.

** my/select-function
Selects the current function using mark-defun, which is language-aware.

* Configuration Options

** Custom Keymap
- ~my-keys-map~ - Sparse keymap for custom keybindings
- ~C-c k~ - Main prefix key for custom keybindings

* Usage Tips

** Learning the Keybindings
- Start with frequently used bindings like buffer management (C-c k b)
- Use Avy for quick navigation (C-c SPC, C-c j)
- Use Expand-Region for precise text selection (C-=, C--)
- Learn MWIM for better line navigation (C-a, C-e)

** Extending the System
- Add new keybindings by extending ~my-keys-map~
- Use the existing category structure for consistency
- Follow the convention of related keybindings in the same category

** Troubleshooting

** Keybinding Conflicts
- Check if a keybinding conflicts with existing Emacs functions
- Use ~C-h c~ followed by the key sequence to check binding
- Verify that required packages are properly loaded

** Package Dependencies
- Ensure Avy and Expand-Region are installed for their keybindings
- Check that Projectile is available for project keybindings
- Verify MWIM is properly loaded for enhanced navigation

** Missing Keybindings
- Confirm that keybindings-init.el is loaded
- Check that custom prefix map is properly defined
- Verify ~global-set-key~ calls execute without errors
