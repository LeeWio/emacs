* Language Support Module Overview

The Language Support module provides configurations for various programming languages to enhance the development experience. It includes language-specific settings and performance optimizations for handling large files.

* Components

** lang-init.el
Initialization file that sets up configurations for multiple programming languages.

* Supported Languages

** Web Development (web-mode)
Configuration for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in web files.

*** Features
- 2-space indentation for markup, CSS, and code
- Auto-quoting disabled for better performance
- Auto-pairing disabled for better performance

*** Customization Options
- ~web-mode-markup-indent-offset~ - Indentation for HTML markup (2 spaces)
- ~web-mode-css-indent-offset~ - Indentation for CSS (2 spaces)
- ~web-mode-code-indent-offset~ - Indentation for embedded code (2 spaces)
- ~web-mode-enable-auto-quoting~ - Auto-quoting of attributes (disabled)
- ~web-mode-enable-auto-pairing~ - Auto-pairing of delimiters (disabled)

** JavaScript (js-mode)
Configuration for JavaScript development.

*** Features
- 2-space indentation
- Language-specific settings

*** Customization Options
- ~js-indent-level~ - Indentation level (2 spaces)

** Python
Configuration for Python development.

*** Features
- Python 3 as default interpreter
- 4-space indentation (standard Python style)

*** Customization Options
- ~python-shell-interpreter~ - Python interpreter (python3)
- ~python-indent-offset~ - Indentation offset (4 spaces)

** Go
Configuration for Go development.

*** Features
- goimports as default formatter
- Auto-format on save

*** Customization Options
- ~gofmt-command~ - Go formatting command (goimports)
- Auto-format enabled on save

** Rust
Configuration for Rust development.

*** Features
- Auto-format on save

*** Customization Options
- ~rust-format-on-save~ - Enable formatting on save (true)

* Performance Optimizations

** Large File Handling
The module includes performance optimizations for large files to prevent Emacs from becoming unresponsive.

*** Features
- Disables syntax highlighting for files larger than 1MB
- Prevents performance degradation when working with large files
- Maintains basic functionality while optimizing resource usage

*** Implementation
- ~my/disable-syntax-highlighting-if-large~ function checks file size
- Applies to files larger than 1,000,000 bytes (1MB)
- Disables JIT lock mode for large files
- Preserves basic syntax table functionality

* Hooks and Integration

The module uses Emacs hooks to apply language-specific configurations automatically:
- ~web-mode-hook~ - Applied when web-mode is activated
- ~js-mode-hook~ - Applied when js-mode is activated
- ~python-mode-hook~ - Applied when python-mode is activated
- ~go-mode-hook~ - Applied when go-mode is activated
- ~rust-mode-hook~ - Applied when rust-mode is activated
- ~find-file-hook~ - Applied when files are opened

* Customization

Each language configuration can be customized by modifying the corresponding setup function:
- ~my/web-mode-setup~ - Web mode configuration
- ~my/js-mode-setup~ - JavaScript mode configuration
- ~my/python-mode-setup~ - Python mode configuration
- ~my/go-mode-setup~ - Go mode configuration
- ~my/rust-mode-setup~ - Rust mode configuration
- ~my/disable-syntax-highlighting-if-large~ - Large file optimization

* Troubleshooting

** Language Mode Not Activating
- Verify that the appropriate major mode is loaded for the file type
- Check if file extensions are properly associated with language modes
- Ensure hooks are properly added

** Indentation Issues
- Check language-specific indentation settings
- Verify that mode-specific settings override general settings
- Confirm that indentation level is appropriate for the language

** Performance Problems with Large Files
- Ensure large file optimization is working
- Verify that syntax highlighting is disabled for large files
- Check if file size threshold is appropriate
